# Resonance-Model
Implementation of resonance model equation and fitting structure

The coding task involves implementing a model equation and fitting structure. The physics
behind the model does not need to be understood.


Resonance model implementation
The resonance model of a system capable of oscillation describes the reaction to excitation
at a given frequency.
In this code, the spectral power is calculated and stored in a text file. So the calculation is 
based on what the user inputs on the command line.
The command line promts the user to enter the values for frequency, amplitude, omega and qFactor.
When the user enters the input, the program calculates the spectral power and saves the results in a text file
When the user terminates, a collection of all the results together with their respective  frequecies can be read
from the file.

Fitting structure
Here a structure is designed, which enables a user to enter all the inputs in a file and just run the program.
The program will read all those inputs and privide the required results.
